Go through the following steps to execute the project.

Step 1) Run DatabaseConvert in eclipse to get the mapped database. Also include the jar files to execute the program correctly.

Step 2) To get the training results of different classes run files:
	A: class_label1.cpp
	B: class_label2.cpp
	C: class_label3.cpp
	All the outputs will be automatically saved in the text files best_chromo1, best_chromo2, best_chromo3 respectively.

Step 3) Run the file named final_rules.cpp to get the best association rules for each class.

Step 4) Run the testing.cpp file to test the results, it will give you the association rules along with the confidence factor.
